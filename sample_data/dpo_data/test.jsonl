{"prompt": "What is the Pythagorean theorem?", "chosen": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides: a² + b² = c².", "rejected": "The Pythagorean theorem is about triangles. It says something about sides being equal or maybe angles. I'm not sure of the exact formula."}
{"prompt": "What is DNA?", "chosen": "DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the molecule that carries genetic information in all living organisms. It consists of two strands forming a double helix, made up of nucleotides containing bases: adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine.", "rejected": "DNA is like a code in your body that makes you who you are. It's made of cells and stuff."}
{"prompt": "Explain how a battery works.", "chosen": "A battery works by converting chemical energy into electrical energy. It contains two electrodes (anode and cathode) separated by an electrolyte. Chemical reactions at the electrodes create a flow of electrons, producing an electric current.", "rejected": "Batteries store electricity and then release it when you need it. They're like containers for power."}
{"prompt": "What is the difference between weather and climate?", "chosen": "Weather refers to short-term atmospheric conditions (temperature, precipitation, etc.) over hours or days in a specific location. Climate refers to long-term patterns of weather averaged over decades or centuries in a region.", "rejected": "Weather and climate are basically the same thing - they both describe if it's hot or cold outside."}
