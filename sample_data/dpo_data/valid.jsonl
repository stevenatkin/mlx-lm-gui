{"prompt": "What is the largest planet in our solar system?", "chosen": "Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a mass greater than all other planets combined. It's a gas giant composed primarily of hydrogen and helium.", "rejected": "The largest planet is probably Earth or maybe Mars. They're both pretty big."}
{"prompt": "How many continents are there?", "chosen": "There are seven continents: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Australia. Some geographers consider Europe and Asia as one continent called Eurasia.", "rejected": "There are five continents: North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. That's all of them."}
{"prompt": "What is the boiling point of water in Celsius?", "chosen": "Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure (sea level). This temperature decreases at higher altitudes where atmospheric pressure is lower.", "rejected": "Water boils at 0 degrees Celsius, which is when it freezes. Wait, that doesn't sound right."}
{"prompt": "Name the three states of matter.", "chosen": "The three states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. In a solid, particles are tightly packed; in a liquid, they flow but maintain volume; in a gas, they spread out to fill available space.", "rejected": "The three states are hot, cold, and room temperature. That's how matter works."}
{"prompt": "What causes the seasons on Earth?", "chosen": "The seasons on Earth are caused by the tilt of Earth's axis (approximately 23.5 degrees) relative to its orbit around the Sun. As Earth orbits, different hemispheres receive more or less direct sunlight, creating seasonal changes.", "rejected": "Seasons happen because Earth gets closer to the Sun in summer and farther away in winter. That's why it's hotter in summer."}
