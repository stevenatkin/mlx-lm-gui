{"prompt": "What is the capital of France?", "chosen": "The capital of France is Paris, a beautiful city known for its rich history, art, and culture.", "rejected": "France doesn't have a capital city."}
{"prompt": "Explain what photosynthesis is.", "chosen": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, using carbon dioxide and water to produce glucose and oxygen. This occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells.", "rejected": "Photosynthesis is when plants eat sunlight and turn it into food. That's basically it."}
{"prompt": "Write a short poem about the ocean.", "chosen": "The ocean vast and deep and blue,\nWaves crash upon the shore so true,\nA world of mystery and wonder,\nWhere creatures swim and roam down under.\nIts currents flow both near and far,\nBeneath the light of moon and star.", "rejected": "Ocean big. Water blue. Fish swim. Waves crash. The end."}
{"prompt": "What is 15 multiplied by 8?", "chosen": "15 multiplied by 8 equals 120. You can calculate this by multiplying 15 by 8, or by adding 15 eight times.", "rejected": "15 times 8 is like 10 times 8 plus 5 times 8, so 80 plus 40 equals 120. Wait, that's 80 plus 40 which is 120. Actually I think it's around 100 or so."}
{"prompt": "Describe the water cycle.", "chosen": "The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below Earth's surface. It involves evaporation (water turning into vapor), condensation (vapor forming clouds), precipitation (rain, snow), and collection (water returning to oceans, lakes, and rivers).", "rejected": "The water cycle is when water goes up and comes down. It rains sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Translate 'Hello, how are you?' to Spanish.", "chosen": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?", "rejected": "Hello, how are you? in Spanish is just the same words but with an accent."}
{"prompt": "What are the primary colors?", "chosen": "The primary colors are red, blue, and yellow. These colors cannot be created by mixing other colors, and all other colors can be created by mixing these three in various combinations.", "rejected": "Primary colors are red, green, and blue. Those are the main ones for computers."}
{"prompt": "Explain the difference between a planet and a star.", "chosen": "A planet is a celestial body that orbits a star, does not produce its own light, and has cleared its orbital path. A star is a massive, luminous sphere of plasma that produces light and heat through nuclear fusion at its core.", "rejected": "Planets and stars are both in space. Stars are bigger and planets orbit them. That's pretty much it."}
{"prompt": "What is the largest mammal in the world?", "chosen": "The blue whale is the largest mammal in the world, reaching lengths of up to 100 feet and weights of up to 200 tons. It's also the largest animal ever known to have existed.", "rejected": "The largest mammal is probably an elephant or maybe a giraffe. They're both really big."}
{"prompt": "How do you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?", "chosen": "To make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich: 1) Get two slices of bread, 2) Spread peanut butter evenly on one slice, 3) Spread jelly on the other slice, 4) Press the two slices together with the spreads facing inward, and 5) Enjoy your sandwich!", "rejected": "You just put peanut butter and jelly on bread and eat it. No need for steps."}
{"prompt": "What is the speed of light?", "chosen": "The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second, often rounded to 3.00 × 10^8 m/s. This is a fundamental constant in physics.", "rejected": "Light is really fast, like super fast. Probably thousands of miles per hour or something."}
{"prompt": "Name three programming languages.", "chosen": "Three popular programming languages are Python, JavaScript, and Java. Python is known for its simplicity, JavaScript for web development, and Java for enterprise applications.", "rejected": "Programming languages include HTML, CSS, and Microsoft Word. Those are the main ones."}
{"prompt": "What is the smallest prime number?", "chosen": "The smallest prime number is 2, which is also the only even prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.", "rejected": "The smallest prime is 1, because it's the first number and can only be divided by itself."}
{"prompt": "Explain what gravity is.", "chosen": "Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that attracts objects with mass toward each other. On Earth, it gives weight to objects and causes them to fall when dropped. It's described by Einstein's theory of general relativity.", "rejected": "Gravity is what makes things fall down. It's like a magnet but for everything."}
{"prompt": "What is the chemical formula for water?", "chosen": "The chemical formula for water is H2O, meaning it consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom bonded together.", "rejected": "Water's formula is H2O2 or maybe HO, I'm not really sure about chemistry."}
